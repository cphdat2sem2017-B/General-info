#General information about 2. semester
For the overall structure of the semester, we attempt to have weekly topics.  
Within each week we have a 4-1 system. 4 days of teaching and daily exercise + 1 day of studypoint exercise with no teaching on fridays. 
For the period of doing the semester project we try instead to have 4 days of working on the project and 1 (sometimes 2) days of teaching. The teaching in this period is meant to be only topics that are immidiately relevant for the project work.
